# TODO for Business Profile Search Message Fix

1. ✅ Change the error message from "Profile not found" to "No user found" when API returns 400 status in fetchProfiles function.
2. ✅ Add logic to display "No user found" when profiles array is empty after a search (when userName is provided).
3. Test the changes to ensure the message appears after clicking the search button if no user is found.
