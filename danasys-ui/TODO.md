# Implementation of Deal of the Day and Greeting of the Day from Category API

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Update ProductCategory interface to include greetingOfTheDay, dealOfTheDayImages, dashboardImages
- [x] Modify Home.tsx to fetch selected category data and pass images to HeroArea
- [x] Update HeroArea.tsx to accept props and conditionally render sections based on image availability

## Followup Steps
- [ ] Test the implementation by selecting different categories and verifying images display/hide correctly
- [ ] Ensure API responses include the new fields (greetingOfTheDay, dealOfTheDayImages)
- [ ] Handle cases where categories have no images (sections should be hidden)
