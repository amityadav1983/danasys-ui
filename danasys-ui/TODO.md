# TODO for Making Orders Tabs Responsive in Business Mode

- [ ] Revise BusinessOrders.tsx to show only 2 tabs at a time in the top bar, add a "More" button, and implement a bottom animated container for the rest of the tabs.
- [ ] Add state management for tab order and bottom container visibility.
- [ ] Implement click handler for bottom tabs to reorder: move selected to first, shift first to second, move second to bottom.
- [ ] Add animation for the bottom container (e.g., slide up/down).
