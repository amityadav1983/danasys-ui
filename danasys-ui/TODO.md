# Search Bar Visibility Implementation Plan

## Steps to Complete:
1. [ ] Modify Header.tsx to accept a heroAreaRef prop and update IntersectionObserver logic
2. [ ] Update Home.tsx to create a ref for HeroArea and pass it to Header component
3. [ ] Test the scrolling behavior to ensure search bar appears only after hero area is scrolled past

## Current Status:
- Plan approved by user
- Starting implementation
